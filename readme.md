# Capstone Project
This repo houses my Udacity CppND Capstone. I have chosen to extend the Snake Game.

# Code Structure

# Rubric Points Addressed
## Loops, Functions, I/O
I added two functions to the `Game` class, `GetHighScore()` and `SetHighScore()` which are responsible for reading and writing the high score from a text file. This functionality addresses the two rubric points listed below.
1. **The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures.**
2. **The project reads data from a file and process the data, or the program writes data to a file.**


# Building
In a terminal, run the following commands:
